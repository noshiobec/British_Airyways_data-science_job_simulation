## British Airways Customer Insight Analysis and Predictive Modelling Project

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    This project showcases my involvement in a virtual internship job simulation with British Airways, focusing on showcasing the contribution of data science to the airline's overall success. It involved scraping and analyzing vast volumes of customer review data to derive actionable insights, providing an invaluable understanding of customer preferences and sentiments. Additionally, a predictive model was meticulously crafted and refined to discern the intricate factors influencing purchasing behaviour, ultimately empowering British Airways to make informed strategic decisions that drive enhanced customer satisfaction and sustainable business growth. The job simulation was divided into two tasks;

### Introduction:
This task involves gathering and analysing customer feedback sourced from the web. The aim is to extract valuable insights from this dataset to enhance strategic decision-making within the organization and elevate customer satisfaction levels. ** The Python codes and presentation of findings can be found in the GitHub files in this repository.**

### Scraping Data from Skytrax Reviews:
In this phase, data was extracted from Skytrax reviews, specifically focusing on feedback related to British Airways. Utilizing Python code provided in the Jupyter Notebook, a comprehensive dataset was compiled, encompassing various customer sentiments and experiences with the airline. This process involved extracting text-based reviews, ratings, and other relevant information from Skytrax, ensuring a robust and diverse dataset for analysis.

### Cleaning and Analyzing Customer Feedback Data:
Following the data collection phase, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning and analysis. Measures were taken to ensure data quality and integrity, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing text formats. Subsequently, advanced analytical techniques such as topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds were applied to delve into the dataset. These analyses revealed valuable insights into customer sentiments, preferences, and pain points, providing actionable information for enhancing the airline's services and addressing customer needs effectively.

### Analysis and Insights:

1. The analysis indicates that customer reviews encompass various aspects of the flight experience, offering a comprehensive overview of passengers' perceptions and experiences.

2. Positive Aspects based on sentiment score of words: Excellent (0.26), Nice (0.20), Friendly (0.19), Comfortable (0.15), Lounge (0.15), Drinks (0.14), Cabin (0.12), Crew (0.15). These positive sentiments reflect key areas where the airline excels in delivering a satisfactory customer experience.

3. Areas of Concern: Poor (0.02), Customer (0.02), Delayed (0.04), Due (0.06), Old (0.06), Last (0.06), Two (0.07), and Luggage (0.07). These aspects highlight specific areas where improvements are needed to address customer dissatisfaction and enhance overall service quality.

4. Addressing concerns related to delays, luggage, and overall customer service is crucial for enhancing the overall travel experience and customer satisfaction. By prioritizing improvements in these areas, the airline can effectively address customer feedback and elevate the quality of service provided.

5. Importantly, many positive reviews do not result in recommendations, emphasizing the need to align with customer expectations for a more recommendable experience. Understanding and meeting customer expectations is essential for fostering positive word-of-mouth and driving recommendations, even in the presence of positive feedback.
